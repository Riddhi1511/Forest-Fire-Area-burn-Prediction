Wildfires cause devastating environmental and economic damage. They do require advanced technologies for better response and resource management. This research work presents an AI-based prediction model for estimating the future area that may burn for the next 2 hours in an ongoing forest fire. The model uses the dataset of Montesinho Natural Park, the real-time geospatial satellite data acquired from API integration, and key environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Several machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, were evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance metric. Out of these, each Random Forest and XGBoost produced the best accuracy, with RMSE of 0.6138. It supports evidence-based decision-making towards efficient wildfire resource allocation and response planning, particularly in often fire-prone regions.
